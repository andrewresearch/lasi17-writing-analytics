> Discuss this session online in the [LASI-17 Room](https://gitter.im/writing-analytics/LASI-17) of the Gitter [Writing Analytics Community](https://gitter.im/writing-analytics).

### A little philosophy    

- Representation and Meaning

- Two worlds of concern
    * The world of the learner (pedagogic)
    * The world of the machine (computational)
    
- Bridge building metaphor
    * asking the pedagogical questions (the world of the learner)
    * critical view of the technical approaches (the world of the machine)
    * building a bridge - a meaning bridge
