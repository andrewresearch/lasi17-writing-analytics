## LASI'17 Writing Analytics :: Session 1


### Introductions 

- background of the group

- The workshop approach
    * not answers, but the right questions
    * not expert, but a guide who has walked the path
    
- Writing Analytics is a non-trivial problem

> Discuss this session online in the [LASI-17 Room](https://gitter.im/writing-analytics/LASI-17) of the Gitter [Writing Analytics Community](https://gitter.im/writing-analytics).

### Overview [Note 00](../notes/00_Overview.json)

- The process from data to learner
- Fundamentals

### A little philosophy    

- Representation and Meaning

- Two worlds of concern
    * The world of the learner (pedagogic)
    * The world of the machine (computational)
    
- Bridge building metaphor
    * asking the pedagogical questions (the world of the learner)
    * critical view of the technical approaches (the world of the machine)
    * building a bridge - a meaning bridge

## Digging deeper 

### Zeppelin basics [Note 01](../notes/01_Basics)

- Tour of GitHub and workshop resources
    * using the workbooks  - or not
    * work in the language you prefer - or try a new one
    
- Workshop approach - working through both processes
    * pedagogical processes 
    * technical processes 
    * how to work together?
    * thoughts on accuracy and precision
    * thoughts on evaluation

### Text Wrangling [Note 01](../notes/02_TextWrangling)    

- cleaning: why is this non-trivial?

- unstructured to structured
    * chunking
    * tokenising
    * multiple approaches may be needed depending on what is ahead (i.e. different algorithms need different text input)
    
- bridge building    
    * what are the implications for pedagogy?
    * what does the theory say?
